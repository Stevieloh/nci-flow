# VLAN MSEG Lab Overview

Nutanix Microsegmentation Solutions exists for both the VPC and VLAN backed networks. Micro-segmentation in VLAN backend environment helps to further isolate communications between different workloads in the same network. In this lab, we will configure microsegmentation for VMs that are in the same VLAN and learn how to apply microsegmentation for workloads in the same VLAN to further enhance the security posture of the VMs.
