# VPC Lab & MicroSegmentation Overview


In the labs so far, we have created the Virtual Private cloud which have allowed isolation between different tenants' workloads. In this lab, we will build on the labs further to enable microsegmentation between workloads within the same subnet in a VPC. Whilst Access Control List help to secure traffic between the subnets, Microsegmentation can provide more granular controls for protecting traffic within the subnet itself 

An overview of the Network Diagram is as per below:
