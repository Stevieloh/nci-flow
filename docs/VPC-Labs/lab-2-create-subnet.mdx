# Lab 2 Creating the VLAN Subnet for External Connectivity (If the Prism Central is shared, only 1 person in group need to perform this)


1.  Under the Infrastructure in the App Switcher
2.  Scroll down on the side bar to go to "Network & Security"
3.  Click on "Subnets"
4.  Click on "Create Subnet" 
5.  Input the following parameters
    - Name : "Primary-External"
    - Type : "VLAN" 
    - Cluster : //Select the Cluster that you are using//
    
    - Once a cluster has been selected, options will appear for VLAN ID and Virtual Switch.  Enter the VLAN number that corresponds to the subnet.  If you want a DHCP server in the subnet, check the IP address management box and you will be prompted to enter the DHCP scope.  Finally, select the virtual switch – in most cases, there is a single virtual switch that contains subnets for the cluster, vs0.

    - Click on the “External Connectivity for VPCs” button to indicate this subnet is used for external connectivity. Once that is done, more options will be displayed as per the screenshot below.

    - Click on the "NAT" checkbox. Ensure that the Checkbox have a tick.
    - Refer to the Network IP address and the Gateway Information provided in the Spreadsheet 
    - IP address Pool: //Please assign an IP Range of 15 IPs//
    - Click on the "Create" Button to create the subnet. 
    
    **The external subnet can be shared by 1 or more VPCs in a real world scenario**
